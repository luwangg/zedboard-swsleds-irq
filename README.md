# zedboard-swsleds-irq
## Control state of LEDs (LD0-LD7) with switches (SW0-SW7)

In order to make use of content of this repository you need to:
1. Have ZedBoard Rev. C
1. Have Xilinx SDK installed. (Originally, I worked with with Xilinx SDK 2017.2)
1. (You donâ€™t need Vivado, as output from Vivado is committed here.)

After cloning the repository you need to import the projects to the SDK/Eclipse, and then:
1. Program FPGA with the image design_1_wrapper.bit (the blue LED Done should light up).
1. Build the zedboard-swsleds-irq project.
1. Deploy the .elf file to the board (Run As > Launch on Hardware)
1. Have fun switching the LEDs on and off :)
